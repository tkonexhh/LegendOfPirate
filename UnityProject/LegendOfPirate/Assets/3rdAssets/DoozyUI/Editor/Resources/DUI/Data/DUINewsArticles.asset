  - title: TouchManager & GestureDetector
    content: 'DoozyUI 2.9 comes with a new module, the TouchManager, that gets created
      automatically when needed, or manually on demand. This manager handles the capture
      of the following gestures: tap, long tap and swipes (on 4 or 8 axis).


      In order to capture and react to a gesture there is a new GestureDetector component
      that can be attached to anything that needs to react to gestures (2D and 3D
      objects).


      This gesture detection implementation is still in its early stages of development
      as we are working on adding more options to it. Should you have any suggestions
      for the TouchManager or the GestureDetector, please let us know.'
  - title: UIDrawer is the first optional module for DoozyUI
    content: 'After a lot of performance and usability tests, the UIDrawer is the
      first optional module for DoozyUI.


      We made sure it works with or without DoozyUI, thus the component can be used
      as a standalone asset as well.


      The UIDrawer is a flexible implementation of a Side Drawer (also known as a
      Navigation Drawer). It can be anchored to any side of the screen and you can
      also use more than one in your UI design (for example, you can have a drawer
      on the left or one on the right, and so on...)

      TouchManager and GestureDetector also come with the UIDrawer component.

  - title: DoozyUI 2.9.2 - New Features
    content: "For this version we implemented new features to give you a better control
      when designing for desktop and console platforms. Thus, along with several fixes,
      we implemented the following:\r\n\u2022 A Controller Input option, for the UIButton
      and UIToggle, that allows you to set a ControllerInputMode (None, KeyCode, VirtualButton)
      that will trigger OnClick. You can set a KeyCode and a KeyCodeAlt (alternate
      button) or a VirtualButtonName and a VirtualButtonNameAlt if you want to use
      buttonNames set in yout InputManager.\r\n\u2022 The UIManager has a new option
      that allows you to set a 'Back' button Input Mode (None, KeyCode, VirtualButton)
      that will trigger the 'Back' button. You can set a KeyCode and a KeyCodeAlt
      (alternate button) or a VirtualButtonName and a VirtualButtonNameAlt if you
      want to use buttonNames set in yout InputManager.\r\n\u2022 UIElement now allows
      you to disable the 'auto select button after show' functionality\r\n\u2022 UIElement
      allows you, if a button is selected, to deleselect it when the UIElement is
      Shown and/or Hidden.\r\n\u2022 UIElement allows you to disable toggling the
      GraphicRaycaster component. If you don't need it, disable it and it will remain
      disabled (if the disable option is enabled).\r\n\u2022 ControlPanel - UIElemens
      - allows you to rename element categories.\r\n\u2022 ControlPanel - UIButtons
      - allows you to rename button categories.\r\n\nAlso, there are a few bug fixes
      that you can read more about in the ReleaseNotes, should you want to learn more.\r\n\nThank
      you for your support!!!\r"
